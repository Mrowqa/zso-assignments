This is my repo I used for the advanced topics in operating systems class
at my university. I have uploaded the repository with an original code
modifying only this README.

Most interesting parts:
- zad2 (big assignment #2) - a custom GPU driver for Linux that allows you
  to play Freedoom (Doom 2 clone). Requires modified qemu with
  the GPU emulator (link at the bottom).
- zad1 (big assignment #1) - a linker that allows calling between 32-bit
  and 64-bit code in one process.

Class resources can be found [here](http://students.mimuw.edu.pl/ZSO/PUBLIC-SO/2018-2019/)
(mostly in Polish).
